*Que nous soyons de ceux*
*qui, à chaque instant,*
*renouvellent et embellissent le monde.*

I'm **Cleo**, french postgrad in public administration and digital humanities. My master thesis focused on AI governance in the French State.

This is a kind-of [[digital garden|garden]].

My **interests** spans across philosophy, cyberculture, programming, ai, politics and governance, cognitive security, network science, poetry.

## Changelog

You can check out how I first made [[this site]].

I have some ideas of things to do. First, adding metadata to my markdown files could be useful, like [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) do. In the same vein, enabling some sort of python notebooks would be nice, or even Lua notebooks. Becoming RSS-friendly could be a cool addition, even if I don't use it myself.

Also, I don't know why I added a timeline button.

# About this site

This site has been made using :

**Rust** and **Vue.Js**

I currently use [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/). Before that, I've tested [Robyn](https://robyn.tech/) which adopt a Python FastAPI-like interface, mixed with a Rust back-end. After that, I tried using [Rocket](https://rocket.rs/).

I settled on Actix, since it's similar to Rocket but is more maintained, as well as Vue to learn a modern framework that is different than the minimalist **HTMX + Alpine.js** I was using before.

I am also very interested in [Dioxus](https://dioxuslabs.com/) !!

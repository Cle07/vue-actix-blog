# The jhanas of Farīd ud-Dīn

*"Before we reach our goal,’ the hoopoe said,
The journey’s seven valleys lie ahead;
How far this is the world has never learned,
For no one who has gone there has returned –"*

> Related to [[Technojhanas]]

The Jhanas are a series of meditative states conceptualized in the early era of Buddhism. Recently described in the scientific literature as an Advanced Concentrative Absorption Meditation^[ [Sparby, T., Sacchet, M.D. Toward a Unified Account of Advanced Concentrative Absorption Meditation: A Systematic Definition and Classification of Jhāna. _Mindfulness_ **15**, 1375–1394 (2024).](https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-024-02367-w)]. In Buddhism, it serves as a catalyzer of virtue, concentration, and peace of mind. The interest in these technics comes from the particularly structured way it has been described. Both practical^[] and phenomenological^[] description can be found in both ancient^[] and contemporary^[] sources.

At the end of my reading of *The Conference of the Birds* by the sufi poet Farīd ud-DīnʿAṭṭār, I stumbled upon something familiar. This long poem of ... lines follow the path of birds - spiritual apprentice - to their goal - union with God^[]. The last part of it make a description of the seven valleys that one has to go through in order to meet *Simurgh* - the king of Birds.

Not so strangely these seven valleys could nearly match the steps as described by the Jhanas. The following diagram shows those side-by-side :

The comparison links cannot be fully accurate since those are describing different spiritual paths, their descriptions may varies, and the lyrical tone of Farīd ud-DīnʿAṭṭār aims not to make a description as precise as Buddhist metaphysicists.

However, the most striking ressemblance is the progression that is described.
Going from an intense experience infused in the body :
